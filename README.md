## Exercise 1

### Objective
During a seminar with your company in an exotic country, you have the
opportunity to participate in several activities. The excursion to an island looks
nice but you prefer to take part in the 2-day hike. The scenery on the paths is
beautiful and you've never slept under the stars before.
You've been gone for more than 10 hours and unfortunately not everything is
going according to plan. It rains a lot, the landscapes are not that nice and you are
exhausted. You thought resting in the tents was going to make you feel better, but
you realize there's one missing.
The sun is almost down and you have to find a solution quickly. It's decided, a
person has to sacrifice himself and it's going to be a short straw. You collect as
much piece of wood as there are people and each your turn you will draw one.
Whoever pulls the smallest piece of wood will sleep without a tent.
You need to determine the first name of the person who is going to sleep without
a tent.
You are assured that there is no equality possible.

### Data format

#### Input
Row 1: an integer N between 10 and 100 corresponding to the number of people
participating in the hike.
Rows 2 to N+1: a string comprising between 5 and 10 lower case characters and
a integer between 1 and 1000 separated by a space representing respectively the
first name of a participant and the length of his piece of wood in centimeters.

#### Output
The first name of the person who will sleep without a tent.
